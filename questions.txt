What are activities?
What do we mean by splitting up the process into a series of activities via a qeueu?
Will each process get their own queue? 
Are the events something we populate before hand, for the simulation?
What are ties? 
How are ties handled?
- You must pick either the one that has a higher event type or has a higher process id?

When we set the time to the next event, when do we increment time, when the process is completely done? 

When we reduce the time quantum of a CPU activity, do we change the actual text in the file? 

What is the Average Response Time?
- For average response time, we keep track of all the points in which the process is waiting for the CPU aka in the ready state
